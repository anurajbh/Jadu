# Jadu
Welcome to Jadu's github page. This is a group created for the Computer as an Expressive Medium class at Georgia Institute of Technology. The theme of the class is "Making with Meaning". "Jadu" means "Magic" in Hindi.

This project was created in Processing, and represents communication spaces between introverts and extroverts. Introversion and Extraversion are the extreme sides of a spectrum of behavioral patterns. We represent introverts as ellipses with no strokes, and extroverts as squares with no fills. However, 1 in 5 times, we can expect to see an introvert with a stroke, and an extrovert with a fill. These decisions, along with the randomness in color, size and strokeweight, represent the wide variety of people that are encompassed by these two words, as well as those that fall in the middle between these two sides. 

Cognitive research on extraversion has revealed a stronger positive correlation between neural activity and reward-sensitive regions of the brain than those who are categorized as more introverted. Often, individuals who are more eager to engage in gregarious activities are seeking positive responses from external stimuli and are thus categorized as extraverts. In conversations, people who exhibit more eagerness to interact in social settings tend to start conversations more readily and break the ice. They are more likely to fill awkward silences and respond more quickly to new ideas or information than to internally reflect on new stimuli. 

We chose to represent extraversion as squares of varying color intensity, stroke weight, opacity, and size. The rectangle is executed wherever the mouse position is, to represent the higher frequency of use.

People categorized as introverts can be just as influential in a conversation as their extraverted counterparts. However, they have a higher tendency to be more reflective on how they respond to outside stimuli. Often encouraging their participation requires more intentionality and time than with an extravert.

On a standard mouse there are left and right click buttons. The right click is used for hidden options. Despite its smaller frequency of use, the right click has a lot of value - particularly it is often the button used to offer more information and more reflective explanations on something less readily understood to a user. And it is the right click that represents the introvert here. The extrovert squares will draw wherever the mouse is pointed, but when the user clicks the right mouse button, introvert circles will draw, and so long as the user keeps holding the mouse, with increasing radius and when the user releases it, the circles will have a random size before the squares start to draw again. This simple right mouse click represents the intentionality that was talked about earlier.
